# Notes

The scripts with name `launch_$APP_tmux.sh` are to be used in binds on `hyprland` or `niri`

The scripts with name `launch_tmux_$APP.sh` are to be used in the `Exec` section of desktop files or when launched either with `xdg-terminal-exec` or with `script-launch-terminal` and its derivatives such as `script-launch-terminal-down`, `script-launch-terminal-fullscreen`, `script-launch-terminal-dropdown` and so on

The only exception is `launch_nvim_tmux.sh` which handles files to be passed to `launch_tmux_nvim.sh`

For binds on KDE since the desktop files are used, everything will be handled by desktop files as specified above
